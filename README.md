# Domotique

A try as to make a tool for the hypixel housing minigame. It's a work in progress but probably won't be finished cause of my ban that just happened.

## Functioning

This tool is a JsMacro script that has the purpose of scanning a personnal housing and automating the migration of actions like htsl does.

## My Hypixel ban

If you're reading this you're praticly surely an hypixel staff and first of all thanks for show an interest in my ban appeal.
I'd like to add a few things, I never wanted to cheat on the server, I just wanted to make a tool to help me with the housing minigame. I'm sorry for the inconvenience I caused. Seeing as Chattrigger macro doesn't seems to ban people, I thought it was the same for JsMacro. I suppose the mod send a packet that warn the server.
As a developper I did get the urge to try to make a tool for the game, as the current one is not really user friendly and I wanted to make a tool that would be more user friendly and more efficient to be able to make the most of the game and pushing it's limits.
